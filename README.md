# Lab4-MayssaHajjHassan_AhmadAbbas

This project focuses on developing user interfaces using both tkinter and PyQt frameworks. The project demonstrates the implementation of GUI applications using Python's two main GUI libraries.

## Technologies Used
- **tkinter**: Python's built-in GUI toolkit for creating desktop applications
- **PyQt**: A comprehensive set of Python bindings for the Qt application framework

## Project Structure
The project includes implementations of GUI applications using both frameworks, showcasing different approaches to desktop application development in Python.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system
- macOS, Linux, or Windows operating system

### Installation and Setup

Follow these step-by-step commands to set up and run the PyQt School Management System:

1. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/Lab4-MayssaHajjHassan_AhmadAbbas
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
   *Note: On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate` instead*

4. **Install required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Run the PyQt School Management System:**
   ```bash
   python PyQt.py
   ```

### What You'll See
The application will open with a graphical interface featuring:
- **Students Tab**: Manage student records (add, edit, delete, search)
- **Instructors Tab**: Manage instructor records (add, edit, delete, search)
- **Courses Tab**: Manage courses, enroll students, and assign instructors
- **Menu Bar**: File operations (Save/Load data, Export to CSV)

### Deactivating the Virtual Environment
When you're done, deactivate the virtual environment:
```bash
deactivate
```
